136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

class Solution {    //using XOR operation
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans =0;  //initializing ans t0 0
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++) {    //remember that 0 XOR number equals to that number only
            ans = ans^nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};


// at first 0 xor first element, now ans = first element
//if it appears second time, that is number xor number it equals to 0
//finally the single time appeared number will be returned
// 0 xor 2 = 2
// 2 xor 2 = 0
