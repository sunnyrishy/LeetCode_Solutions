Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
       if(n<=0) {
           return false;
       }
       else {
           return ((n & (n-1)) ==0) == true;   //logical and operation
       }


        
    }
};

//example 8 = 1000 and n-1 = 0111
//do and operation between n and n-1
//if the result is all 0's then n is a power of 2 
//else not a power of 2
